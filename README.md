# Analyzing and drawing the Graph of 'Open,Adj Close' at one Market dataset
#  I investigate this sample of Market to know about the effect of some features on Ad close in a Market.
There were some challenges in some columns such as : Removing the last column because it is all zero, Converting all floats to integers and Sorting based on Date.
# Then I started to draw some graph to detect and clean Noise and error. 
# after Deleting the detected noise, I redraw the graph and check the removed noise
